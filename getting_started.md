# Getting started
To introduce the main features of the NeXus Constructor we will create a NeXus file template describing a simple neutron beamline, comprising a neutron source, sample, detector and monitor.

Firstly, either download the [latest release](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/nexus-constructor/releases) for your OS and run the executable from the root directory, or run the source (refer to the [README](README.md) for instructions on how to do this).

You will be shown the main window of the application (pictured below) which contains a list of *components* which comprise the beamline, and a 3D view visualising the components listed with their respective shape and position.

The sample component is added by default, and is indicated by the red cube. You can move around the 3D view by using the arrow keys to move, click+drag to pan, and pgup/down to zoom.

If you are familiar with the [NeXus format](resources/introduction_to_nexus.md) it may be useful to view the layout of the resulting NeXus file as you modify the template by adding components and other information. You can do this by clicking the "Nexus File Layout" tab in the left pane of the main window.

## Adding components

Click the "add component" button.

![](resources/images/Selection_003.png)


In this screen, we are given options to set what type of component it is, its shape, as well as being able to add fields to describe it further.
As well as these options, the NeXus format documentation for the component type selected is shown on the right. This suggests what fields to add. You can add undocumented fields with additional information, but the ones in the documentation may be able to be used by other software which reads NeXus files.

### Adding a source

In the add component window select "NXsource" from the drop-down containing all of the component types.

Name the component as "source1".


As you can see highlighted in the documentation, we can add a field to describe the source. To do this, select the "add field" button.

![](resources/images/Selection_005.png)

When inputting the name of the field, in this case we'll add "type", you will see that typing in the name edit will bring up an autocompleter with all of the documented field names.

![](resources/images/Tooltip_006.png)


Set the data type of the field by selecting the type combo and selecting "String". In the value edit, enter one of the options specified in the "type" field in the documentation on the right. In this case, let's use `Spallation Neutron Source`

Hit the "Add component" button to save it (Note: you can edit this component once saved by selecting it in the list and using the "Edit component" button near to the add button).
You will notice in the 3d view there is a new cube which has been added that is black. Currently it overlaps the sample, to remedy this we should add a transformation to the newly added source component.

#### Setting translation on the source

To the right of the "Add component" button in the main window toolbar, three additional controls can be used to add transformations to a component. Here we have the option to translate, rotate and link to another component's transformations.

Select the source component in the list by clicking it, then click the "add translation" button.

You will see upon adding a new translation the black cube gets shifted to the right immediately. This is because of the default vector specified in the translation. By default the field is disabled, but to edit these fields simply click on it. When finished editing, clicking elsewhere in the list will save the changes.

The beam direction is conventionally along the z-axis, so use a vector of (0,0,1) and the set a distance of `-20m`. Distance units can be changed with the units field next to the value.

### Adding a detector

*Detectors* are a key component of any beamline. A detector comprised of an array of detecting pixels can be used to infer the angle that the neutrons/muons/photons scattered from the sample.

Enter the "Add component" dialog and select "NXdetector" as the component type. Notice pixel data options appear.

In this example our detector is comprised of a 16x16 grid of pixels.

Select "Cylinder" as the "Shape type" and set the height as 0.5 and radius as 0.3, and leave the units as "m".

![](resources/images/AddComponent_010.png)

We will select the "repeated single pixel shape" here and enter the rows and columns as 16. The row and column heights can be left as their default values.


When hitting add, you will notice that the 3D view is updated should contain a grid of 16x16 cylinders. We now just need to move it backwards from the sample by applying another transformation of 5 metres along the z-axis.

### Adding a Monitor

We will add a monitor with a mesh shape to the instrument. To do this, add another component.
When the Add component Dialog is shown, select "NXmonitor" as the component type.


##### Loading shape from a CAD file
Alternatively to cylinder shapes, mesh shapes can be used for components to describe their shape. Currently STL and OFF files are supported for mesh geometry.

To use a mesh file for geometry, select the "Mesh" geometry type. This will show an option to browse for a file. As well as this, units can also be set to change the scale of the geometry.
To test this, there are OFF and STL files in the `tests/` folder. Let's use the "cube.off" file.   

![](resources/images/AddComponent_011.png)

Again, this would need to be moved away from the sample if reflecting a real scenario. It may also need to be rotated. To add multiple transformations, select "Add rotation" or "Add translation" in the order you want them to be added.

### Opening and saving file-writer commands

We now have a very basic example of a beamline instrument visualised in 3D as well as the resulting NeXus file. The constructor can output to a [file-writer command](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/kafka-to-nexus/blob/master/documentation/commands.md) in JSON format, and can also load from these files.
To save to a JSON file, open the file menu and click "Save to filewriter JSON". This will bring up a file dialog in order to save the file.

To open a JSON file, open the file menu and click "Open from filewriter JSON". The constructor will then load in all components and their fields from a given file.

#### Sending a command to the file-writer

As well as saving the NeXus structure to file, a run start message can be constructed and sent to an instance of the [file-writer](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/kafka-to-nexus)
To do this, open the file menu and select "Control file writer". This will bring up a dialog that enables a user to input [Kafka topic](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_topics) URIs to look at the status of any active file-writers or to send a command to one.

### Opening and saving to NeXus File

The NeXus Constructor can also directly create a NeXus file. However, note that it will not populate the file with data from Kafka
