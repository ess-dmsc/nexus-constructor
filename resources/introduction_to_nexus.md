## A very brief introduction to NeXus
NeXus is a standard, used by neutron, X-ray and muon facilities all over the world, for storing experiment data. It is based on the Hierarchical Data Format v5 ([HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)). An HDF file contains _groups_ and _datasets_ which are analogous to directories and files in a file system but reside in a single file. Groups and datasets can also have metadata attached, called _attributes_.

The NeXus format describes a range of [_classes_](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes) which have named _fields_. An instance of a class in a file is a group, with an `NX_class` attribute specifying the class name, containing datasets which correspond to the fields. There are classes to describe all sorts of metadata, for example who was carrying out the experiment, as well as typical beamline components. For example  a vertical slit can be recorded as group with an "NX_class" attribute of "NXslit", containing a dataset called `x_gap` with a value of the slit width and a "units" attribute for the value.
