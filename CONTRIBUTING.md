## Issues 

When creating an issue, please add it to the kanban board project. It will be placed in the selected column.

## Branches 
### Branching
* Branch your feature off 'master'
* Create pull requests against 'master'

### Branch naming

The names should start with the ticket number and contain a brief description seperated by underscores. For example:
`84_adding_pr_template`

## Pull Requests 
There is a template for pull requests. This should contain enough information for the reviewer to be able to review the code efficiently.

## Code style
All code should be pep8 compliant, we have a linter built into the CI system. 
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html) code style should be followed where possible unless readability is compromised. 

## Unit tests
Tests should be written/modified for any code added or changed (within reason, of course).
